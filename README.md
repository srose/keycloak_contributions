# Contributing to Keycloak

This is dedicated to learn how to do contributions to [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak).

If these things are considered useful enough to be somehow find a way inside [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) itself they will be removed from here.

The sessions will be part of the meetup [Keycloak hour of code](https://www.meetup.com/keycloak-hour-of-code)

Get in touch if you would like to do share something.
